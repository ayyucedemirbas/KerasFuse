# Security Policy



## Versions



## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to maintainers. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.



## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability. 🙊

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
